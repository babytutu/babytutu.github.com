# EPIC DAILY “BLUE MARBLE” API

Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera

> The EPIC API provides information on the daily imagery collected by DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument. Uniquely positioned at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point, EPIC provides full disc imagery of the Earth and captures unique perspectives of certain astronomical events such as lunar transits using a 2048x2048 pixel CCD (Charge Coupled Device) detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope.
